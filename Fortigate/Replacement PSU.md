### Replacement Fortinet power supply

Most Fortinet models (for example the 40F or 30E) will use this connector...
![Figure1.1](./Images/Figure1.1.jpeg)

That connector type is the Molex Mini-Fit Jr.  What we will do is purchase a replacement ([example1](https://www.digikey.co.za/en/products/detail/molex/2153262021/13883021) or [example2](https://www.digikey.co.za/en/products/detail/molex/2451350210/6564766)), and solder it to any standard 12v DC power supply.

The side with the locking clip and 45° contacts is the positive.  The contact that is perfectly square is negative.
