### Replacement Fortinet power supply

Most Fortinet models (for example the 40F or 30E) will use this connector...

That connector type is the Molex Mini-Fit Jr.  What we will do is purchase a replacement (for example a Molex [215326-2021](https://www.digikey.co.za/en/products/detail/molex/2153262021/13883021) combo, or the [46992-0210](https://za.rs-online.com/web/p/wire-housings-plugs/1448173) and [39-00-0217](https://za.rs-online.com/web/p/crimp-contacts/1790819) pair), and solder it to any standard 12v DC power supply.

The side with the locking clip and 45° contact is the positive.  The contact that is perfectly square is negative.
